Atlas ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes how Atlas handles your information.

## Information We Collect

Atlas is designed to minimize data collection. We do not collect, store, or transmit your browsing history, search queries, or downloaded files to any external servers.

### Data stored on your device

- **Browsing data** - History, cookies, and cache are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to us.
- **Files** - Files saved using built-in file storage remain on your device. We do not have access to them.
- **Settings** - Your app preferences are stored locally on your device.

### Data we may collect

- **Crash reports** - If you opt in, anonymized crash reports may be sent to help us improve the app. These contain no personally identifiable information.
- **Beta feedback** - If you choose to submit feedback through TestFlight, Apple may share your email address and feedback with us.

## Third-Party Services

Atlas does not include third-party analytics or advertising SDKs. Websites you visit may have their own tracking mechanisms, which Atlas aims to block by default.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.

## Data Security

Since your data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your device's security features, including encryption and biometric authentication.

## Children's Privacy

Atlas does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
